This will have the most up to date executable .jar of the program for public testing without needing to compile the program. 

Compiled with OpenJDK 13 and OpenJFX 13.

	Added but not implemented a 'level selection' state to allow graphical selection of levels.
	When loading a new map the engine will now load .meta data to generate NPCs both allies and enemies
